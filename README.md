- To work in teams and learn from each other.

### In this project, We build a Java software / program by going through the following design processes:
- Designing a program by drawing UML diagrams which will help in describing and designing Java classes.
- Expressing object orientation through exploring classes, interfaces, inheritance, polymorphism, abstraction, exception handling, and collection.
- Implementing and debugging an object-oriented program and enhancing it if there is a need.
- Documenting the program through Javadoc tool in NetBeans IDE.
